No NIH Category available, ,Characterizing the serum metabolome in multiple sclerosis,PROJECT NARRATIVEIt is possible that in the U.S. near 20% of the 90000 persons with an established multiple sclerosis (MS)diagnosis may have been misdiagnosed with 60-70% having been on FDA-approved MS immunomodulatorytherapies. Misdiagnosis represents an unacceptable burden thus there is a critical need for accuratediscrimination of MS from non-MS conditions and there is a need for biomarkers that can monitor diseaseactivity and progression. We hypothesize that the serum metabolome is an attractive non-invasive target foridentifying such biomarkers. In this proposal we seek to: 1. Identify and characterize biomarkers thatdiscriminate MS and from non-MS conditions and unaffected controls and 2. Identify biomarkers of relapseactivity and biomarkers that distinguishes relapsing from progressive forms of MS.,NINDS,11048557,4/9/2024 0:00,PA-21-268,7R01NS121928-04,7,R01,NS,121928,04, ,"UTZ, URSULA",8/7/2023 0:00,3/31/2025 0:00,"Neurological, Aging and Musculoskeletal Epidemiology Study Section[NAME]", ,12457811,"BRIGGS, FARREN B.

In this proposal we willtest the hypothesis that glucagon and insulin generate a unique hepatic signature that leads to optimal systemicglucose utilization.,NIDDK,10950888,1/30/2024 0:00,PA-21-268,7K01DK129417-04,7,K01,DK,129417,04, ,"SPAIN, LISA M",8/1/2021 0:00,7/31/2026 0:00,"Diabetes, Endocrinology and Metabolic Diseases B Study Section[DDK-B]", ,11525365,"CAPOZZI, MEGAN ",Not Applicable,07,INTERNAL MEDICINE/MEDICINE,605799469,HD1WMN6945W6,605799469,HD1WMN6945W6,US,47.660307,-122.315168,9087701,UNIVERSITY OF WASHINGTON,SEATTLE,WA,SCHOOLS OF MEDICINE,981959472,UNITED STATES,N,1/30/2024 0:00,7/31/2024 0:00,847,Other Research-Related,2023,110016, ,NIDDK,101867,8149, ,110016

This approach fills a critical unmet needin psychiatry by generating mathematically precise variables that can bridge the gap between pathophysiologyand psychopathology. The main goals of the current project are to: 1) test the idea that computational metricshave enhanced validity and sensitivity relative to standard behavioral performance metrics in key psychiatric andnonpsychiatric populations and to relate these metrics to EEG markers of brain function; and 2) establish andoptimize the psychometrics of these computational metrics so that they can be used as tools in treatmentdevelopment longitudinal studies and genetic studies.!,NIMH,10931287,11/9/2023 0:00,PAR-17-256,7R01MH084826-13,7,R01,MH,084826,13, ,"MORRIS, SARAH E",9/30/2000 0:00,6/30/2024 0:00,Special Emphasis Panel[ZRG1-BBBP-L(03)M], ,6592122,"CARTER, CAMERON S.",Not Applicable,47,PSYCHIATRY,046705849,MJC5FCYQTPE6,046705849,MJC5FCYQTPE6,US,33.64852,-117.82136,577504,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA-IRVINE,IRVINE,CA,SCHOOLS OF MEDICINE,926970001,UNITED STATES,N,11/2/2023 0:00,6/30/2024 0:00,242,Non-SBIR/STTR,2023,310839, ,NIMH,271004,39835, ,310839

Consequently the vascular systems ofmiddle- and older-aged women may be poorly prepared for and more vulnerable to a sharp rise in acuteoxidative stress i.e. from obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) which contributes to the development of hypertensionand CVD. To address these significant issues we will study women and men aged 50-75 years with moderate-to-severe OSA to identify sex-specific differences in: a) the effects of OSA on overnight oxidative stress andinflammatory biomarkers; b) vascular function; and c) the effects of standard OSA therapy plus a supplementalantioxidant therapy or placebo.,NHLBI,10930195,9/23/2023 0:00,PA-20-183,1R56HL168675-01A1,1,R56,HL,168675,01,A1,"DONZE, LAURIE FRIEDMAN",9/23/2023 0:00,8/31/2024 0:00,"Cancer, Heart, and Sleep Epidemiology B Study Section[CHSB]", ,8710484,"AURORA, RASHMI NISHA",Not Applicable,12,INTERNAL MEDICINE/MEDICINE,121911077,M5SZJ6VHUHN8,121911077,M5SZJ6VHUHN8,US,40.669895,-73.974354,5998304,NEW YORK UNIVERSITY SCHOOL OF MEDICINE,NEW YORK,NY,SCHOOLS OF MEDICINE,10016,UNITED STATES,N,9/23/2023 0:00,8/31/2024 0:00,837,Non-SBIR/STTR,2023,757364, ,NHLBI,473127,284237, ,757364

First the mechanism of an endogenous intracellular anti-addictive phospholipase C signalingpathway in the nucleus accumbens shell will be investigated to identify targets for the reduction of opioid use in humans. Second cocaine-induced maladaptive changes in dendritic spines in the nucleus accumbens shell will be selectively targeted and removed optogenetically to determine if a direct causal relationship exists between the reversal of these morphological brain changes and reductions in addictive behavior.,NIDA,10929771,10/12/2023 0:00,PA-21-268,7K01DA046513-06,7,K01,DA,046513,06, ,"TSAI, SHANG-YI ANNE",9/15/2023 0:00,3/31/2025 0:00,Molecular Neuropharmacology and Signaling Study Section[MNPS], ,10939438,"ANDERSON, ETHAN MICHAEL",Not Applicable,06,VETERINARY SCIENCES,075050765,ECQEYCHRNKJ4,075050765,ECQEYCHRNKJ4,US,30.408018,-91.188669,577907,LOUISIANA STATE UNIV A&M COL BATON ROUGE,BATON ROUGE,LA,SCHOOLS OF VETERINARY MEDICINE,708030001,UNITED STATES,N,9/15/2023 0:00,3/31/2025 0:00,279,Other Research-Related,2023,110000, ,NIDA,101852,8148, ,110000

The growing rheumatologyworkforce shortage further aggravates these issues as <10% of rheumatologists practice in rural or micropolitanareas yet 30% of the US population lives in these areas. Our goal is to reduce healthcare disparities to improveoutcomes in patients with RA by: (1) identifying rural healthcare disparities in diagnosis and treatment of earlyRA (2) developing and validating an AI algorithm to enable early identification of RA and (3) assessing long-term outcomes in patients with RA living in rural vs urban areas compared to those without RA.,NIAMS,10929530,9/21/2023 0:00,PA-20-185,2R56AR046849-21,2,R56,AR,046849,21, ,"MAO, SU-YAU",9/1/2000 0:00,8/31/2024 0:00,"Aging, Injury, Musculoskeletal, and Rheumatologic Disorders Study

Wepropose experiments to test the hypothesis that during neuroinflammation the cytokine IL-13 contributes to theloss of dopaminergic neurons which express its receptor IL-13R1. The originality and significance of this worklie in the hypothesis that an anti-inflammatory cytokine can contribute to neurodegeneration. This represents aparadigm shift from the current view that anti-inflammatory cytokines are invariably neuroprotective andprovide a mechanism that explains the selective loss of dopaminergic neurons in PD. The data collected may alsoopen novel therapeutic strategies. If successful these experiments will make a significant contribution to the fieldof neurodegenerative disorders by showing IL-13 IL-13R1 and their signaling are potential novel targets forpreventing Parkinsons disease or slowing its progression at least in a subset of patients.,NINDS,10928425,9/21/2023 0:00,PA-20-185,1R56NS134632-01,1,R56,NS,134632,01, ,"SIEBER, BETH-ANNE",9/21/2023 0:00,8/31/2024 0:00,Chronic Dysfunction and Integrative Neurodegeneration Study Section[CDIN], ,6836864,"CONTI, BRUNO ",Not Applicable,50,Unavailable,079166097,ZM3DYHAGMKM3,079166097,ZM3DYHAGMKM3,US,32.894055,-117.202589,10035282,SAN DIEGO BIOMEDICAL RESEARCH INSTITUTE,SAN DIEGO,CA,Research Institutes,921211155,UNITED STATES,N,9/21/2023 0:00,8/31/2024 0:00,853,Non-SBIR/STTR,2023,646104, ,NINDS,350000,296104, ,646104

In 2017 to tackle the uniquechallenges of decreased treatment initiation engagement and adherence to addiction treatment for Black andLatinx people with SUDs we developed Imani (meaning Faith in Swahili) Breakthrough a faith-based person-centered culturally-informed harm reduction recovery program through a community based participatoryprocess (in collaboration with key stakeholders) that takes place in churches. The main goal of this currentstudy is to increase the methodological rigor of Imani by conducting a randomized controlled trial (RCT) toexamine whether adding a Church-based Telehealth MAT option to Imani (Imani + CTM) will improveoutcomes for Black and Latinx people with AUD or OUD compared to Imani + traditional MAT Referral andLinkage (Imani + MAT R&L) in the community.,NIDA,10928308,9/13/2023 0:00,RFA-RM-21-021,3U01DA060441-02S1,3,U01,DA,060441,02,S1,"ZUR, JULIA BETH",9/23/2021 0:00,5/31/2026 0:00,Special Emphasis Panel[ZRG1-MOSS-T(50)R], ,8886773,"BELLAMY, CHYRELL DENISE","JORDAN, AYANA ",03,PSYCHIATRY,043207562,FL6GV84CKN57,043207562,FL6GV84CKN57,US,41.310925,-72.926428,9420201,YALE UNIVERSITY,NEW HAVEN,CT,SCHOOLS OF MEDICINE,065208327,UNITED STATES,N,9/1/2023 0:00,5/31/2024 0:00,279,Non-SBIR/STTR,2023,148566, ,NIDA,88696,59870, ,148566

These experiments will address the hypothesis that consumption of foods high in fatsignificantly elevate inhibition of brainstem vagal motor neurons responsible for the generation of vagal motordrive to the heart. This proposal develops a novel neuromechanistic model by which a microcircuit within thebrainstem underpins increased vagal inhibition after the consumption of a diet high in fat.,NHLBI,10916834,1/6/2024 0:00,PA-21-268,7R01HL157366-03,7,R01,HL,157366,03, ,"TJURMINA, OLGA A",4/1/2022 0:00,3/31/2026 0:00,Integrative Vascular Physiology and Pathology Study Section[IVPP], ,11400600,"BOYCHUK, CARIE RENEE",Not Applicable,03,VETERINARY SCIENCES,153890272,SZPJL5ZRCLF4,153890272,SZPJL5ZRCLF4,US,38.948231,-92.327335,578002,UNIVERSITY OF MISSOURI-COLUMBIA,COLUMBIA,MO,SCHOOLS OF VETERINARY MEDICINE,652110001,UNITED STATES,N,1/6/2024 0:00,3/31/2024 0:00,837,Non-SBIR/STTR,2023,417195, ,NHLBI,269158,148037, ,417195

Despitestrong reasons for concern about the cardiovascular toxicity of three widely-prescribed non-opiates we knowrelatively little about their cardiovascular side effects. This knowledge gap is particularly important becausepain management is a leading factor for Veterans seeking medical care and their complex conditions placethem at higher risk than the general population. We aim to determine whether these drugs place patients athigher risk for adverse cardiovascular outcomes.

Inthis proposal we will 1) finalize the prototype of Change My Story a narrative digital game with a choose-your-own-adventure format in which young players navigate difficult experiences based on drivers of psychologicaldistress and depression and 2) integrate this game into a comprehensive task-shifted PST intervention tooptimize engagement in mental health care to improve treatment outcomes.,NICHD,10914342,9/14/2023 0:00,PAR-19-376,4R33HD106578-03,4,R33,HD,106578,03, ,"YATES, FRANKLIN WILLEM",9/14/2023 0:00,9/15/2023 0:00,Special Emphasis Panel[ZRG1-IMST-U(55)R], ,10906918,"AHONKHAI, AIMALOHI ",Not Applicable,07,Unavailable,079917897,GYLUH9UXHDX5,079917897,GYLUH9UXHDX5,US,36.143784,-86.800995,10040927,VANDERBILT UNIVERSITY MEDICAL CENTER,NASHVILLE,TN,Independent Hospitals,372320011,UNITED STATES,N,9/14/2023 0:00,9/15/2023 0:00,865,Non-SBIR/STTR,2023,1, ,NICHD,1,0, ,1

Weidentified three drug combinations for which simultaneous application of two drugs targeting G2/M was muchmore active than either drug alone with a lead combination showing strong efficacy and no toxicity in a mousexenograft model for head and neck cancer. The project will establish the mechanism of drug combinationeffectiveness identify response biomarkers determine how various complements of TP53 and CDKN2Amutations affect response and perform a clinical trial to assess combination drug activity in head and necktumors in humans.,NIDCR,10913240,8/24/2023 0:00,PA-21-071,3P50DE030707-04S2,3,P50,DE,030707,04,S2,"CHEN, ZHONG",9/22/2020 0:00,6/30/2025 0:00,ZCA1,7838,1938272,"BURTNESS, BARBARA ",Not Applicable,03,Unavailable,043207562,FL6GV84CKN57,043207562,FL6GV84CKN57,US,41.310925,-72.926428,9420201,YALE UNIVERSITY,NEW HAVEN,CT,Domestic Higher Education,065208327,UNITED STATES,N,7/1/2023 0:00,6/30/2024 0:00, ,Research Centers,2023, ,74139, ,44262,29877, ,

Such data can provide unique illumination into factors on wherewe live work and play which can be used to better understand and address health disparities acrossnoncommunicable disease infectious disease and injuries in the Kenyan context. However the data are oftenunstructured and can have complex relationships with health outcomes making the use of modern data scienceapproaches critical. DSSD leverages strong investment across biomedical public health data science andartificial intelligence investment at both partners (NYU School of Medicine is 11th in the nation for NIH fundingNYU is home of the AI-now institute and Moi University has a strong NIH funding record) as well as a broadernetwork of academic industrial and non-governmental organizations (IBM Deep Learning Indaba DataKindAI.Kenya and Aga Khan University Nairobi and Karachi) opening a wide pool of potential strong trainees fromboth data science and health backgrounds. To develop capacity priority will be given to Moi affiliates Kenyancitizens and then others from anywhere in Africa while also prioritizing diversity. A complementary team of 23mentors at NYU and Moi committed to training and career development will offer resources across socialdeterminants biomedical sciences statistics epidemiology data management analytics and ethics. First theprogram will provide long-term development of a cohort of PhD postdoctoral and Faculty fellow trainees whowill benefit from interdisciplinary training that carefully layers a core set of competencies in data science acrossdata management and wrangling prediction and analytics and data communication and ethics with didactic andexperiential training in social determinants as well as best practices in responsible conduct of researchreproducibility and community-engaged ethical data science at NYU. Second the program will leverageinternational standard biostatistics and informatics faculty and programming at Moi with trainees equipped inadvanced data science coursework at NYU to expand the base of local expertise and capacity in data scienceby developing MSc and PhD data science tracks at the Institute for Biomedical Informatics and Biostatisticsprograms at Moi University within 5 years. Finally continuing education opportunities and networking will occurthrough workshops bringing together experts in health and data science in Kenya and surrounding areas.Programs will be evaluated annually by our Internal Advisory Board and Training Advisory Committee. As socialdeterminants can be cross-cutting rather than disease-specific classroom and research opportunities acrosssocial determinants and their applicability to wide range of health application domains will be available at bothproject sites and curricula will be relevant to research and training efforts across the entire DSI-Africa consortium.,FIC,10912916,8/23/2023 0:00,RFA-RM-20-016,3U2RTW012121-03S1,3,U2R,TW,012121,03,S1,"POVLICH, LAURA",9/22/2021 0:00,7/31/2026 0:00,Special Emphasis Panel[ZRG1-PSE-C(70)], ,10587997,"CHUNARA, RUMI ","HOGAN, JOSEPH W; MWANGI, ANN ; VEDANTHAN, RAJESH ",10,BIOSTATISTICS & OTHER MATH SCI,041968306,NX9PXMKW5KW8,041968306,NX9PXMKW5KW8,US,40.729659,-73.997018,5998301,NEW YORK UNIVERSITY,NEW YORK,NY,SCHOOLS OF PUBLIC HEALTH,100122300,UNITED STATES,N,8/1/2023 0:00,7/31/2024 0:00,989,Other Research-Related,2023,212573, ,OD,204474,8099, ,212573

Tumor correlates associated with MEK inhibition in animals and subsequent response toimmunotherapy will be evaluated in paired patient tumor biopsies; furthermore we will perform laboratoryexperiments to optimize therapy sequence and schedule and confirm the functionality of MHC-II expression(induced by MEK inhibition) in tumor cells as a mediator of immunologic response.

Effective treatment may be limited by concern over hypoglycemia (low blood sugar) acommon and potentially hazardous side effect. To monitor for this side effect and improve the safety of care forVeterans with diabetes this study will identify patients with hypoglycemia using patient surveys and searchesof text in medical records for notation by clinicians. Other information will be collected in surveys and from theelectronic health record and used in predicting which patients will have hypoglycemia.

No NIH Category available, ,Development of a Wake Forest Multi-Species NHP Biorepository to Support Interdisciplinary Aging Studies,Non-human primates (NHP) such as baboon cynomolgus macaque rhesus macaque and vervet are susceptible to the same age-related health challenges and diseases as humans. The overall aging trajectory in NHP is also influenced by stressors and lifestyle similar to humans. Research in NHP allows for controlled environments providing longitudinal data with less noise than in human studies. Identification of molecular mechanisms underlying aging in multiple NHP species will significantly increase the likelihood that these mechanisms translate to human aging. The goals of this study are to generate an integrated NHP resource to support aging studies (R21 phase) and to demonstrate the utility of this resource for comparative omic studies in four NHP species (R33 phase).,NIA,10909446,9/11/2023 0:00,PAR-20-070,4R33AG073733-03,4,R33,AG,073733,03, ,"MORO, MANUEL H",8/15/2021 0:00,8/31/2026 0:00,NSS, ,1959545,"COX, LAURA A","HOWARD, TIMOTHY D; SHIVELY, CAROL A.",05,INTERNAL MEDICINE/MEDICINE,937727907,SN7KD2UK7GC5,937727907,SN7KD2UK7GC5,US,36.059402,-80.321981,9021205,WAKE FOREST UNIVERSITY HEALTH SCIENCES,WINSTON-SALEM,NC,SCHOOLS OF MEDICINE,271570001,UNITED STATES,N,9/15/2023 0:00,8/31/2024 0:00,866,Non-SBIR/STTR,2023,774994, ,NIA,499996,274998, ,774994

However the mechanisms underlying altered tumor metabolism and AR-V7-releated oncogenic programs in CRPC are far from clear. Our recent preliminary studies point to YY1 a zincfinger transcription factor showing significant overexpression during disease progression of CRPC. YY1maintains high expression of both metabolic genes and the AR-V7-related gene targets. YY1 thus constitutes acompletely new mechanism that might account for major malignant alterations in metabolism and androgensignaling seen in CRPC. The current proposal will explore this novel mechanism that underscores CRPCprogression and therapeutic resistance. The successful completion of the proposed research shall allow adeeper understanding of how the terminal CRPC disease progresses and will help to rationally develop novelstrategies to treat the affected patients. Thus this proposal is significant innovative and may potentiallytranslate into the clinic to improve CRPC treatment.,NCI,10907068,8/28/2023 0:00,PA-21-268,7R01CA262903-03,7,R01,CA,262903,03, ,"KONDAPAKA, SUDHIR B",7/15/2021 0:00,8/31/2026 0:00,Tumor Cell Biology Study Section[TCB], ,15714486,"CAI, LING ",Not Applicable,04,PATHOLOGY,044387793,TP7EK8DZV6N5,044387793,TP7EK8DZV6N5,US,36.007766,-78.926475,2221101,DUKE UNIVERSITY,DURHAM,NC,SCHOOLS OF MEDICINE,277054673,UNITED STATES,N,9/1/2023 0:00,8/31/2024 0:00,395,Non-SBIR/STTR,2023,435136, ,NCI,281184,153952, ,435136

Specifically the UWCCC will do this by decreasing cancer incidence andmortality among populations within our catchment area and beyond including our minority and underservedpopulations. We will facilitate pursuit of this goal through partnerships with other health delivery systems andstate and community agencies for dissemination of evidence-based findings. The UWCCC will accomplish ourgoals through nurturing a diverse and supportive cancer community reliable infrastructure and efficientresources. During the current funding period UWCCC continued to decrease the burden of cancer in ourcatchment and beyond through prioritized research areas (e.g. innovative therapies and biomarkers cancerimaging and expanded population-based cancer research) enhanced research platforms (e.g. improved clinicalresearch infrastructure and shared resources) increased efforts to build mission-related philanthropy andexpanded local-to-global partnerships.,NCI,10905065,9/4/2023 0:00,PAR-21-321,3P30CA014520-49S3,3,P30,CA,014520,49,S3,"SHAFIK, HASNAA",4/25/1997 0:00,3/31/2028 0:00,Cancer Centers Study Section (A)[NCI-A], ,1877637,"BAILEY, HOWARD H.",Not Applicable,02,INTERNAL MEDICINE/MEDICINE,161202122,LCLSJAGTNZQ7,161202122,LCLSJAGTNZQ7,US,43.068519,-89.400858,578503,UNIVERSITY OF WISCONSIN-MADISON,MADISON,WI,SCHOOLS OF MEDICINE,537151218,UNITED STATES,N,6/21/2023 0:00,3/31/2024 0:00,397,Research Centers,2023,194375, ,NCI,125000,69375, ,194375

Approximately 50000 obtain carefor PD through the Veterans health care system. Patients with PD are treated with drugs that augmentdopamine neurotransmission. An unfortunate common side effect of drug treatment is levodopa induceddyskinesias (LID). These purposeless unwanted jerking or wiggling movements cause reduced quality of lifeas it worsens in severity over the years. Treatment options are limited and include expensive deep brainsurgical procedures for some. Animal models of LID show statins delay the onset of dyskinesia and then retardits progression in severity over time. Our project will study whether statin intake during levodopa initiation andcontinuation prevents the inevitable worsening of LID over time and thus preserves quality of life in PD.,VA,10903709,9/4/2023 0:00,RFA-CX-18-004,5I01CX001547-05,5,I01,CX,001547,05, , ,4/1/2019 0:00,3/31/2024 0:00,ZRD1-NURE-C(01)1, ,8162653,"CHUNG, KATHRYN ANNE",Not Applicable,01,Unavailable,089461255,E8GJCMVHFJ63,089461255,E8GJCMVHFJ63,US,45.496479,-122.683191,481073,PORTLAND VA MEDICAL CENTER,PORTLAND,OR,Independent Hospitals,972392964,UNITED STATES,N,4/1/2023 0:00,3/31/2024 0:00,999,Non-SBIR/STTR,2023, , , , , , ,

Most of our knowledgeabout sensory differences in autism come from studies of systems like vision that inform the brain about theexternal environment but the brain has massive sensory input from within the bodythe internal sensoryenvironment including signals from the heart lungs and gut. The integration of internal and external sensorysignals are important for social interaction and emotional regulation and the proposed study will advance ourunderstanding of how and why this integration is different in autism and its effects on core symptoms and co-occurring anxiety.,NIMH,10899969,8/10/2023 0:00,PA-18-401,3R01MH102272-10S1,3,R01,MH,102272,10,S1,"GILOTTY, LISA",8/7/2014 0:00,7/31/2024 0:00,Special Emphasis Panel[ZRG1-BBBP-L(02)M], ,9422884,"CASCIO, CARISSA J",Not Applicable,07,Unavailable,079917897,GYLUH9UXHDX5,079917897,GYLUH9UXHDX5,US,36.143784,-86.800995,10040927,VANDERBILT UNIVERSITY MEDICAL CENTER,NASHVILLE,TN,Independent Hospitals,372320011,UNITED STATES,N,8/1/2023 0:00,7/31/2024 0:00,242,Non-SBIR/STTR,2023,146105, ,NIMH,84454,61651, ,146105

One or more of these proteins mayprove to be valuable as a new therapeutic target to reverse tumor immortality specifically in TERT promotermutant cancer cells sparing TERT-expressing normal stem cells.

Cervicalcancer is closely associated with HPV infection and 99% of cervical cancer is due to persistentHPV infection. HPV is a DNA virus which has many types of HPV (<150) and many do notcause problems. HPV infections usually clear up without any intervention within a few monthsafter acquisition and about 90% clear within 2 years. A small proportion of infections withcertain types of HPV can persist and progress to cervical cancer.,NCI,10896570,9/18/2023 0:00,PA-19-272,4R44CA250663-02,4,R44,CA,250663,02, ,"LOU, XING-JIAN",9/22/2023 0:00,8/31/2025 0:00,Special Emphasis Panel[ZRG1-IMST-J(10)B], ,12008130,"CHO, HYUNDAE ",Not Applicable,49,Unavailable,041375710,LFE6DJ6KL4E5,041375710,LFE6DJ6KL4E5,US,33.102266,-117.196363,10034968,"CROSSLIFE TECHNOLOGIES, INC.",CARLSBAD,CA,Domestic For-Profits,92008,UNITED STATES,N,9/22/2023 0:00,8/31/2024 0:00,394,SBIR/STTR,2023,994004, ,NCI,663554,265422, ,994004

Successful completion of the aims will reveal the impact of Western diet consumption on the structure and function of the maternal gut microbiome and microbially-derived metabolome during pregnancy elucidate the molecular and neurophysiological mechanisms by which opportunistic pathogenic bacteria increased by Western diet consumption impair host cognitive function and identify targeted modulation of the maternal gut microbiome as an innovative approach to improving cognitive health outcomes in children affected by maternal prepregnancy diet-induced obesity.,NICHD,10895023,8/2/2023 0:00,PA-21-268,7R01HD109095-02,7,R01,HD,109095,02, ,"RUSSO, DENISE",7/25/2022 0:00,5/31/2027 0:00,Nutrition and Metabolism in Health and Disease Study Section[NMHD], ,9195744,"BUFFINGTON, SHELLY A",Not Applicable,09,NEUROSCIENCES,051113330,FXKMA43NTV21,051113330,FXKMA43NTV21,US,29.70926,-95.400851,481201,BAYLOR COLLEGE OF MEDICINE,HOUSTON,TX,SCHOOLS OF MEDICINE,770303411,UNITED STATES,N,8/1/2023 0:00,5/31/2024 0:00,865,Non-SBIR/STTR,2023,511221, ,NICHD,319513,191708, ,511221
